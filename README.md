# fitnessTracker
An app designed to help users keep track of their exercises in detail. They can keep track of which exercises they do, 
the weight being used, the duration, the sets and reps as well.
 This app is set up with Mongoose and express. This was more of a practice run to get used to making Mongoose db models. 
 It is a work in progress. :/
